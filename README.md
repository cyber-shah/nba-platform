- Implement efficient data management practices to ensure accuracy and reliability.

#### Frontend Website:
- Develop a user-friendly frontend website for easy interaction with the database.
- Provide a seamless interface for users to access and explore NBA-related insights.

#### User Flow:
- Establish a clear user flow, outlining commands and methods for user interaction.
- Enhance the user experience with intuitive navigation and data visualization.


## README.txt

1. Unzip the file.
2. There are two main components to this project: the frontend and the backend.
   - The frontend is a website that allows you to interact with the database.
   - The backend is express that calls mysql database to perform CRUD operations.
3. To run the application, you must have node.js installed on your computer.
   - To install node.js, please visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
   - run `npm install` in the frontend folder and the root folder.
   - cd into the frontend folder and run `npm start`.
   - cd into the root folder and run `node server/mainServer.js`.
4. This should open the website on your browser and start the backend server.
5. The backend server calls the mysql database to perform CRUD operations.

3. Click on the "Teams" tab to view all the teams in the NBA.
   - Click on the "Team Roster" tab to view the roster of all the teams in the NBA.
     - Click on on any player to view their Headshot, Name, Position.
4. Click on the "Players" tab to view all the players in the NBA.
6. The website supports 16 CRUD operations.
   - Create
     - Create a new player.
     - Create a new team.
     - Create a new season.
     - Create a new game.
   - Read
     - Read all the players.

     - Update a game.
     - Update Arena
   - Delete
     - Delete a player.
     - Delete a team.
     - Delete a arena.
     - Delete a game.
7. There is a navigation bar on the top of the website that allows you to navigate to the different pages of the website. Specifically on the CRUD operations page, you can navigate to the different CRUD operations by clicking on the buttons on the navigation bar.
8. Each CRUD operation has a form that allows you to input the data that you want to create, update, or delete.
9. Once you have inputted the data, click on the "Submit" button to submit the data.
10. If you want to update or delete data, you must input the primary key of the data that you want to update or delete.
11. If you want to read data, you can click on the "Read" button to read the data.
12. If you want to go back to the home page, you can click on the "Home" button on the navigation bar.
13. If you want to go back to the CRUD operations page, you can click on the "CRUD Operations" button on the navigation bar.
